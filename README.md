# BitBoss Project

## About
BitBoss is an open-source project analyzing blockchain technologies in depth. The BitBoss website is a blog as well as an analysis site of various cryptos.

We track these currencies using various APIs and scripts and output them in an easy to understand user interface.

In addition to the analysis, we also run a blog covering the latest news in the cryptosphere as well as a weekly blog series where we try to find lesser known blockchain technologies that we feel have a lot of potential.

## This Repo 
This repo will be used to upload all of our code as our site is happily open-sourced. Once the website is complete, we will be uploading all of our scripts used to analyze the currencies for anyone who wants to use them.

By using our scripts/code you agree to the license in this repo and will give credit where it is due with a link back to our website. These scripts utilize various APIs, so if we give any credit to anyone in the script, leave it. This is most likely because it is required and removing it would violate their license.

Our scripts as of now include the following:
- Current price, market cap, and volume.
- Future price prediction (not financial advice!)
- Crypto compare (compare key aspects of two cryptos. also view against eachother in a graph)
- Steemit upvote value calculator
- Steemit rewards calculator (calculates your reward and the curation reward being given)
